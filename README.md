# SmirkNet.io – Proof of Emotion Protocol 🌍💥

Welcome to **SmirkNet.io**, a Web3-native platform built around **emotion-driven engagement**, **viral content monetization**, and the revolutionary **Proof of Emotion Protocol**.

## 🎯 What is SmirkNet?
SmirkNet is a hybrid platform combining:
- A **viral game** that challenges users to fake emotions
- An **AI Roaster** that detects emotional responses and roasts users using GPT
- A **creator monetization protocol** that helps trace, tokenize, and reward original emotional content (laughs, smirks, reactions)
- A **Web3 engagement engine** that lets anyone mint NFTs, earn from virality, and build digital clout

> We believe *emotion is the next currency*. SmirkNet makes it traceable, ownable, and bankable.
